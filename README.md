# Travel Website (React + Vite)

This project is a simple travel website built with React and Vite.

## Pages

- Home page
- Destinations page
- Booking page
- Random trip (suggest a random trip to user)

## Functionality

- Home page should show your upcoming trips with suggestions for hotel and activities.
- When a user books a trip, display a GIF related to the user's destination.
- Users should be able to cancel a trip, but we should make this as difficult for the user as possible.
- When giving users random destinations, let the user specify destinations they do not want, and then make a suggestion using the remaining destinations.
- When a user is booking/cancelling, send a bunch of spam to the user's email.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
